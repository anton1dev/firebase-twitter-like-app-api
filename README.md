# Firebase-Nestjs-React Tweeeetie App

In this marvelous project I've implemented a little but pretty-designed and really simple-to-use social application just like Twitter (X).

User's credentials, posts, photos and so on are storing on Firebase Storage, so App is absolutely safe-to-use as well as several number of real social networking projects.

App is live on: https://fir-twitter-like-app.web.app/

Take it, hold it, love it!

## Used technologies

During development process, I've used several web-technologies:

- `JavaScript` as well as the main programming language for Web-development;
- `Nest.js`, probably the best back-end framework to develop a powerful and reliable application that can store all the data;
- `React.js`, `React Router`, several `React` hooks as well;
- `Bulma`, easy to install & learn but so powerful UI lib for `React`;
- `Firebase` and several services: `Firestore`, `Firestore Auth`, `Hosting`, `Functions` for deploying back-end, `Storage`;
- `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `Husky` for best code-style.

## Description

This application simulates a real Twitter functionality.

First of all, you should login or sign up in App.
You can use Google Auth button, or use your own credentials (email and password will be enough).

`Feed` is a main tab of Application. Here you can read all the articles from several users, create your own Post, leave a comment, update or delete your previous Posts.
`Homepage` is like an entry-point to application. Generally, I'll finish implementation of that page later.
`Profile` is your own Cabinet - here you can upload you new Avatar, view your credentials, change or even delete your account.

Last, but not least - Logout button. Just one click - and you'll be anonymous!

## Instructions

Main option for You as a customer - using a deployed application.
Generally, there is no need to run app locally.
